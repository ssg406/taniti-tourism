# Taniti Tourism Website
A sample tourism website for the fictional island of Taniti

## About the Project
I built this site initially for a UX Design class at Western Governor's University. We were given basic content to use in the site, but the design was left up to us. Since then, I've continued adding to the design as my CSS and HTML skills have developed.
